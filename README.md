# pokeemerald Expansion
# About this branch
This branch adds 3 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations:
* Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
* Power-Up (Vitamins and evolution items)
* Battle Items (X items, Pokédoll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)

The new order for the pockets is the following:
* Items
* Medicine
* Poké Balls
* Battle Items
* Berries
* Power-Up
* TMs & HMs
* Key Items

The pokeemerald Expansion is a feature branch meant to be integrated into existing Pokémon Emerald hacks based off pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project.

There are some mechanics, moves and abilities that are missing and being developed. Check [the project's milestones](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/milestones) to see which ones.


My implementation is a modified version of part of this [commit](https://github.com/BluRosie/em-remake/commit/4999f9ca4efe5b4b8fec8172cf2a7c364e0ad07e) from BluRosie that was shared a few years ago, that put playtime in the same location. Please credit them rather than me, they did all the difficult work.

## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use the pokeemerald Expansion
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of the Expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of the pokeemerald Expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/1.6.0`.

Lastly, if you do speed up the in-game clock, it's possible the start menu clock won't refresh as fast as you'd like it to. You can increase the refresh rate by adding a conditional just before the the last return statement in `HandleStartMenuInput`, here:
https://github.com/Pawkkie/pokeemerald-expansion/blob/f9cceba5e07af02719079d869a3e6d57fd3f5269/src/start_menu.c#L699

## There's a bug in the project. How do I let you guys know?
Please submit any issues with the project [here](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/issues). Make sure that the issue wasn't reported by someone else by searching using the filters.

## Can I contribute even if I'm not a member of ROM Hacking Hideout?

    if (!GetSafariZoneFlag() && !InBattlePyramid() && gSaveBlock2Ptr->playTimeSeconds == 0) 
    {
        RemoveExtraStartMenuWindows();
        UpdateClockDisplay();
    }

## Who maintains the project?

The project was originally started by DizzyEgg alongside other contributors.

The project has now gotten larger and DizzyEgg is now maintaining the project as part of the ROM Hacking Hideout community. Some members of this community are taking on larger roles to help maintain the project.

## What is ROM Hacking Hideout?

Feel free to reach out to Pawkkie on Discord if you've got any concerns, but please do so in a romhacking channel so others can also benefit :)
